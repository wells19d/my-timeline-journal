      Ever shared a moment of your past when suddenly you forgot... when, where,
      or what exactly happened during that moment? Well for me it's been
      happening a lot as I've gotten older. In the past I've tried writing down
      my thoughts and events in a journal, but as we all know today's world has
      become a busier place. Having time to sit and organize your thoughts has
      become a challenge. Sure, you can use a medium like "Facebook", add some
      entries about your day, and then you worry about what others have to say
      or even think about what you are doing with your life... suddenly you've
      become bitter and stop writing. Lately I've been thinking it would be nice
      if you could have some app program that you could see as a timeline. You
      could enter details about your day, maybe a few pictures, and save it to
      your timeline. Let's say a few days later you remembered something you
      wanted to addâ€¦ Well, you just select that date and make a quick edit. How
      about you remembered something from your childhood, and you don't want to
      forget about it? Not a problem, you still select the date, write the
      details, and drop it in. The point of the app is it wouldn't matter what
      date you wanted to add, edit, move, or remove, you could easily do so and
      have access to these memories whenever you wanted.
